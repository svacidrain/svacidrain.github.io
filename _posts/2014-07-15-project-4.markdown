description: There are currently 5 sets of snorkeling gear onboard that your welcome to use, you may of course wish to use your own. At almost every anchorage there is a chance to snorkel and see some beautiful fish and reefs, if you enjoy fishing or spearfishing there are basic rods onboard and a couple of spear guns. We always try to practice sustainable fishing and only take what we need. This is a great way to learn about fish, habitats and the environment.
